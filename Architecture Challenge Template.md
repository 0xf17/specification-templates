**CHALLENGE OBJECTIVES**

_(Avoid more than 3 bullet points. The objective should be clear and concise. The goal is to have members understand what we want as the deliverable for this challenge)_

*   Create a document to provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the system.
*   The document may include Use Case View, Logical View, Data View, Deployment View etc.
*   In each view, there should be some diagrams to illustrate the details.

**PROJECT BACKGROUND**

_(Avoid more than 3 bullet points. The background should be clear and concise)_

*   The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that will be used by physicians to track order status and view order results for patients they have under their care. 
*   Through the order results, the application will also assist physicians in determining which antibiotics to prescribe to patients.
*   The application will be used in doctors offices and hospitals across the US.

**TECHNOLOGY STACK**

_(Please specify the technology stack for this application)_

The following technology stack might be used in the application.

**SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS**

_(The document must include the following sections. The specific formats for these documents and diagrams can be found in the [document template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GTi0EmMUffm-wzdcMYhCOtr-zlb7z2t0sdqc60Cg3Ig/edit?usp=sharing), which should be shared as a challenge attachment.)_
