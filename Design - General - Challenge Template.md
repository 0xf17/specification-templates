### Project Background

_(Never more than 3 bullet points. The background must be very clear and concise.)_



*   The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that will be used by Physicians to track order status and view order results for patients they have under their care.

*   The application will be used at hospitals across the US.


### Workflow

_(Please copy this section from the project input form)_

Please make sure your design incorporates this workflow.


| Workflow Step # | Description |
|-|-|
| Step 1 | The user launches the mobile app |
| Step 2 | The user (without any log in) enters their basic information (Age, current salary, working years, Accumulated Saving amount in AFP, Gender… and if the user has worked before 1998 (Public Pension System - Legacy) the application asks for the number of years worked and the average salary earned in 1996 in order to be able to estimate the amount that should be transferred from the Public System to the AFP Pension System. |
| Step 3 | The application generates the base simulation |



### Users/Roles

Please make sure your design supports the following roles.
